# Computer Vision

## Make Sense

[makesense.ai][1] is a free to use online tool for labelling photos. Thanks to the use of a browser it does not require any complicated installation - just visit the website and you are ready to go. It also doesn't matter which operating system you're running on - we do our best to be truly cross-platform. It is perfect for small computer vision deeplearning projects, making the process of preparing a dataset much easier and faster. Prepared labels can be downloaded in one of multiple supported formats. Documentation and more details can be found in the project [repository][2].

# Natural Language Processing

## Doccano

doccano is an open source text annotation tool for human. It provides annotation features for text classification, sequence labeling and sequence to sequence. You can create labeled data for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text summarization etc. https://doccano.herokuapp.com/

  abstract = {We introduce INCEpTION, a new annotation platform for tasks including interactive and semantic annotation  (e.g., concept linking, fact linking, knowledge base population, semantic frame annotation). These tasks are very time consuming and demanding for annotators, especially when knowledge bases are used. We address these issues by developing an annotation platform that incorporates machine learning capabilities which actively assist and guide annotators. The platform is both generic and modular. It targets a range of research domains in need of semantic annotation, such as digital humanities, bioinformatics, or linguistics. INCEpTION is publicly available as open-source software.},
